Introduction to Churn Analysis

In today's competitive business environment, retaining customers is crucial for long-term success. Churn analysis is a key technique used to understand and reduce this customer 
attrition. It involves examining customer data to identify patterns and reasons behind customer departures. By using advanced data analytics and machine learning, businesses
can predict which customers are at risk of leaving and understand the factors driving their decisions. This knowledge allows companies to take proactive steps to improve 
customer satisfaction and loyalty.


**Project Target**

1.Create an entire ETL process in a database & a Power BI dashboard to utilize the Customer Data and achieve below goals:
2.Visualize & Analyse Customer Data at below levels
3.Demographic
4.Geographic
5.Payment & Account Info
6.Services
7.Study Churner Profile & Identify Areas for Implementing Marketing Campaigns
8.Identify a Method to Predict Future Churners


**Metrics Required**

1.Total Customers
2.Total Churn & Churn Rate
3.New Joiners

**STEP 1 - ETL Process in SQL Server**

So the first step in churn analysis is to load the data from our source file. For this purpose we will be using Microsoft SQL server because it is a widely 
used solution across the industry and also because a full-fledged Database System is better at handling recurring data loads and maintaining data integrity 
compared to an excel file.

**Creating Database**

After installation, you will land on the following screen. Do remember to copy paste the server name somewhere because we will need this at a later stage. 
Also enable the checkbox which says “Trust Server Certificate” and then click on Connect
Once connected, click on NEW QUERY button at the top ribbon and then write below query. This will create a new Database named db_Churn

	CREATE DATABASE db_Churn

**Data Exploration – Check Distinct Values**

SELECT Gender, Count(Gender) as TotalCount,

Count(Gender)  1.0 / (Select Count() from stg_Churn)  as Percentage

from stg_Churn

Group by Gender

 

SELECT Contract, Count(Contract) as TotalCount,

Count(Contract)  1.0 / (Select Count() from stg_Churn)  as Percentage

from stg_Churn

Group by Contract

 

SELECT Customer_Status, Count(Customer_Status) as TotalCount, Sum(Total_Revenue) as TotalRev,

Sum(Total_Revenue) / (Select sum(Total_Revenue) from stg_Churn) * 100  as RevPercentage

from stg_Churn

Group by Customer_Status

 

SELECT State, Count(State) as TotalCount,

Count(State)  1.0 / (Select Count() from stg_Churn)  as Percentage

from stg_Churn

Group by State

Order by Percentage desc
